		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hi everyone! My name is Viktoriia. I am from Moscow. I am currently working as a Software Developer in one famous company.
		My dream is to become a Software Engineer and become an intern in one of the greatest companies of this time, for example, <b>Google</b> or <b>SpaceX</b>. Given this I have decided to start this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web/home/welcome">course</a> on Coursera.</p>
		<div>So first of all let's move to my "wish" list. I want to...</div>
		<ul>
		  <li>To visit <em>Giza's pyramids</em> from inside. I have been loving Egypt and its culture and myths since childhood</li>
		  <li>To dive on <em><b>Maldives</b></em>. I cannot imagine the colour of the water there. I think this is a heaven on Earth</li>
		  <li>To work at  <em><b><a href="https://careers.google.com/students/">Google</a></em></b>. Yes, it seems to me a greate life experience</li>
		  <li>To speak and write <em>English</em> fluently. That is why I decided to create this page in English</li>
